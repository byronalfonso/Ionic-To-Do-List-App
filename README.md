##App Icon and Splash Screen
Along with the code, I have create a simple app icon and splash screen image(store on the /resources folder). To use them, simply add a platform e.g. 'cordova platform add and' then run 'ionic resources'. Ionic will automatically generate icons and splashscreens for all existing platforms.

##Testing:
Due to limited resources, the app was only tested using two android devices running on version 4.2. The results of the testing was quite good. The app works as is supposed to work (Please report any bug if you've seen any).
